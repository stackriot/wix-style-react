## Setup

> __Note:__ This library depends on watchman, install it by following [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

```sh
nvm use
npm install
npm start
open localhost:6006
```

`npm start` spins up a server at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). this is our reference/sandbox.

## Components guidelines

* One component per file
* All assets in `src/assets` folder
* e2e & unit test as well as enzyme & protractor testkits. See [Testing](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Introduction&selectedStory=Testing&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0) for details.
* Prefer [controlled components](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/)
* support `rtl` boolean prop to support right-to-left languages

## Adding new component

* check github issues if no one else is working on same component
* use `WixComponent` as super class for your component, e.g.: `class MyComponent extends WixComponent`
* use spread `...` instead of `Object.assign`, e.g.:

    ```js
    // bad
    MyComponent.propTypes = Object.assign(
      {},
      SomeOtherComponent.propTypes,
      { customProps: PropTypes.string }
    );

    // good
    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      ...SomeOtherComponent.propTypes,
      customProps: PropTypes.string
    };
    ```

    It's important since in a good case we are able to automatically parse the source and create API docs for your component.

* design according to [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5864e02695b5754a69f56150) design created by UX guild.
* follow [Documenting Components](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Introduction&selectedStory=Documenting%20components&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0) to configure and generate docs automatically.
* add unit and e2e tests as well as testkits for enzyme and protractor. See [Testing](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Introduction&selectedStory=Testing&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0) for details.
* export your `testkitFactory` from the following files:
    * `wix-style-react/testkit/index.js`
    * `wix-style-react/testkit/enzyme.js`
    * `wix-style-react/testkit/protractor.js`

## Writing test drivers
* drivers should be a good way to inteact with the component when testing and do one of the following:
  * make a side effect (click)
  * retrieve some data (some value / is checked)
  * another component driver to interact with (an autocomplete the uses an input can return the input driver)
* drivers should test the behavior and not test React, so do query for props but values.
* use `data-hook`s to query for elements in the DOM.
* enzyme / vanilla drivers should be written without any enzyme related functionality, they should stay pure vanilla dom manipulation.
* Each test has sanity check for testkit and should use the `isTestkitExists` and `isEnzymeTestkitExists`.
* notes regarding existing drivers:
  * Do not use the `setProps` method. this function will not work for the consumer of this driver.
  * Support `exists()` method also when the result should be false. for example, syntax like `element.childNodes[0]` should be more safe: `if (element) { element.childNodes[0] }...`

## Adding new icon

* receive the approval for the new icon from one of the library's UXs [wuwa](https://github.com/wuwa) or [milkyfruit](https://github.com/milkyfruit)
* go to [wix-ui](https://github.com/wix/wix-ui) repo to [wix-ui-icons-common](https://github.com/wix/wix-ui/tree/master/packages/wix-ui-icons-common) package
* add it to the **system** icons folder if it's an icon used internally inside a wix-style-react component, or to the **general** in case it is an icon to be used inside an app
* add your icon to correct package folder inside [wix-ui-icons-common](https://github.com/wix/wix-ui/tree/master/packages/wix-ui-icons-common)
* create pull request for [wix-ui](https://github.com/wix/wix-ui) with your new icon
* after merging your pull request, in wix-style-react's package.json - update wix-ui-icons-common's version to the new one
* the new icon wil be available in wix-style-react with such syntax `import MyAwesomeIcon from 'wix-style-react/new-icons/MyAwesomeIcon'` or `import MyAwesomeIcon from 'wix-style-react/new-icons/system/MyAwesomeIcon'`
