# Mobile Web Guidelines

This document describes best practices to create a mobile-friendly web application using wix-style-react.

Here's a [demo application](https://apps.wix.com/wix-style-react-mobile) that follows the practices below (also rendered with [SSR](https://apps.wix.com/wix-style-react-mobile/ssr)).

## Perquisites

These guidelines are aligned with wix-style-react v6.47.0 (and above).

Notice that using `react-responsive`'s `useMediaQuery` hook requires React v16.8.0 - however you can always use `MediaQuery` component for earlier versions.

## Fluid Design

ℹ Fluid Design means that elements adapt and scale relatively to any viewport size.

- Use [`<Page/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--page)'s `minWidth` prop to make the page content be fluid for small viewports.

  > Why? The page content has default `minWidth` which might not be suitable for small viewports.

  ```jsx
  <Page minWidth={0}>
    <Page.Header title="Title" />
    <Page.Content>Content</Page.Content>
  </Page>
  ```

- Use [`<ModalMobileLayout/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--modalmobilelayout) to display a fluid modal layout.

  > Why? This modal layout adapts to all viewport sizes.

  ```jsx
  <ModalMobileLayout
    title="Title"
    content={<div>Content</div>}
    footer={<div>Footer</div>}
  />
  ```

- Use [`Layout's family`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--layout) to display a fluid grid (instead of [`<Box/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--box)).

  > Why? The Layout's family provides API for creating a two-dimensional layout. In contrast, `<Box/>` is a one-dimensional layout that doesn't fit this case at all (we could combine two `<Box/>` to make a grid but there are no actual benefits but rather just redundant complexity).

  ```jsx
  <Layout>
    <Cell>Header</Cell>
    <Cell span={6}>Left</Cell>
    <Cell span={6}>Right</Cell>
  </Layout>
  ```

- Use [`<Button/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--button)'s `fullWidth` prop to make the button be completely fluid (as necessary).

  > Why? The default button width is determined by the text, however sometimes it should be fluid (mainly when emphasizing the button presence).

  ```jsx
  <Button fullWidth>Text</Button>
  ```

## Responsive Design

ℹ Responsive Design means that elements change behavior or style on different devices and viewports.

- Use the meta viewport tag to determine the width and scaling of the browser's viewport.

  > Why? Viewport is the area within the browser which actually displays the webpage.
  > Mobile browsers render firstly the webpage within a virtual viewport (that usually wider than the device's screen), and then, the viewport is shrunk down to fit the physical dimensions of the screen.
  > This might cause the content to seem shrunk as well. Using `width=device-width` makes the virtual viewport to match the physical dimensions from the beginning, so the browser renders the content by its own screen without shrinking.
  > Notice that rotating the device to landscape wides the virtual viewport, which eventually might lead to the same problem. Using `initial-scale=1` adjusts the CSS pixels and device-independent pixels to be in a 1:1 relationship, regardless of device orientation.

  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  ```

- Use a media query to modify the element's style and behavior, based on the device properties.

  > Why? It allows making responsive elements that look well and function in all viewport sizes and various devices.

- Use [react-responsive](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive) instead of using `window.matchMedia` web API directly.

  > Why? Without the library, it means you need to manage an event listener for the window resize or media query change on our own, when the library already does that **efficiently**.

  ```javascript
  // bad
  const { matches: isTablet } = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 1194px)');

  // good
  import { useMediaQuery } from 'react-responsive';
  const isTablet = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: '1194px' });
  ```

- Use the specified design system breakpoints.

  > Why? These breakpoints are recommended by the design system, considering all of the devices and constraints.

  ```javascript
  import { useMediaQuery } from 'react-responsive';
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: 'TBD' });
  const isTablet = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: '1194px' });
  const isDesktop = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: 'TBD' });
  ```

- Create your breakpoint component wrappers.

  > Why? These semantic and reusable wrappers guarantee you import react-responsive only in one place and define the breakpoints once.

  ```jsx
  // option 1 - `MediaQuery` component
  import React from "react";
  import MediaQuery from "react-responsive";
  const Tablet = ({ children }) => (
    <MediaQuery maxWidth="1194px">{children}</MediaQuery>
  );

  // option 2 - `useMediaQuery` hook
  import { useMediaQuery } from "react-responsive";
  const Tablet = ({ children }) => {
    const isTablet = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: "1194px" });
    return isTablet ? children : null;
  };

  // usage
  render() {
    return (
      <Tablet>
        <div>This appears only for tablet devices</div>
      </Tablet>
    );
  }
  ```

- Use [`<Layout/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--layout) to display a responsive grid.

  > Why? `<Layout/>` is flexible, which makes it easy to restructure - especially when we need to change the amount of columns and the gap using media query.

  ```jsx
  import { useMediaQuery } from "react-responsive";
  const isTablet = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: "1194px" });

  render() {
    return (
      <Layout cols={isTablet ? 6 : 12} gap={isTablet ? 20 : 30}>
        <Cell span={6}>
          Content
        </Cell>
        <Cell span={6}>
          Content
        </Cell>
      </Layout>
    );
  }
  ```

## Native Controls

ℹ Native Controls refers to standard elements that are available and integrated for any browser, regardless of the device, but applies the style of that browser.

- Use [`<Dropdown/>`](https://wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/components-api-components--dropdown)'s `native` prop to display the native dropdown menu (example: [native only for mobile](https://github.com/wix-private/wix-style-react-mobile/blob/master/src/components/Content/BasicInfo/BasicInfo.tsx#L48)).

> Why? For mobile devices, the selection experience is mostly better when using native dropdown.

```jsx
<Dropdown
  options={[
    { id: 0, value: 'Option 1' },
    { id: 1, value: 'Option 2' },
  ]}
  native
/>
```

## Testing

- Use react-responsive's Context to set the viewport while testing responsive components with JSDOM.

> Why? It allows setting the device properties easily, without messing with simulating a `resize` event.

```jsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import React from 'react';
import { useMediaQuery, Context as ResponsiveContext } from 'react-responsive';
import Button from 'wix-style-react/Button';

const isTablet = useMediaQuery({ maxWidth: '1194px' });
const App = () => (
  <div>{isTablet && <Button dataHook="my-button">Text</Button>}</div>
);

describe('App', () => {
  it('should render the button on tablet', async () => {
    const { findByTestId } = render(
      <ResponsiveContext.Provider value={{ width: 1194 }}>
        <App />
      </ResponsiveContext.Provider>,
    );

    // Assuming testIdAttribute is configured to be 'data-hook', as described here:
    // https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-configuration
    expect(await findByTestId('my-button')).not.toBe(null);
  });
});
```

- Use Puppeteer's device descriptors to set the viewport while testing responsive webpages with Puppeteer.

> Why? It allows setting the device properties easily and simply.

```js
import { ButtonTestkit } from 'wix-style-react/dist/testkit/puppeteer';
const { devices } = require('puppeteer');

// Assuming our app component renders the following on tablet viewport sizes:
// <Button dataHook="my-button">Text</Button>

describe('App', () => {
  const iPad = devices['iPad Pro'];
  let buttonTestkit;

  beforeEach(
    async () =>
      (buttonTestkit = await ButtonTestkit({
        dataHook: 'my-button',
        page,
      })),
  );

  it('should not display the button on desktop', async () => {
    await page.setViewport({
      width: 1920,
      height: 1080,
    });
    await page.goto(app.getUrl('/'));

    expect(await buttonTestkit.exists()).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should display the button on tablet', async () => {
    await page.emulate(iPad);
    await page.goto(app.getUrl('/'));

    expect(await buttonTestkit.getButtonTextContent()).toBe('Text');
  });
});
```

## Server-Side Rendering

⚠️ Make sure you've configured the `.st.css` files [hook](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/FAQ/README.md#making-server-side-rendering-ssr-work) and [imported](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/FAQ/README.md#components-do-not-have-styling-in-the-first-render-of-server-side-rendering-ssr) the Stylable output separately.

- Prefer applying media queries using CSS over device-based APIs (such as `matchMedia` or react-responsive) when possible.

> Why? The server doesn't recognize the `window` neither `document`. This means that the device properties, including viewport size, aren't detectable and the server-rendered markup might be defective. In contrast, media queries that are applied using CSS will be included in the markup, which is hydrated later and detected by the browser.

- Use `userAgent` to detect information regarding the device.

> Why? It allows inferring the device type from the client and passing that to the server-side renderer.

```javascript
const userAgent = req.headers['user-agent'] || '';

const isMobile = ['mobile', 'tablet'].some(deviceType =>
  userAgent.toLowerCase().includes(deviceType),
);
```

- Use react-responsive's Context to manually prepare the viewport measurements for the initial render.

> Why? It allows passing the `value` prop through the responsive components thereby matching the server-rendered markup before the hydration process.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Context as ResponsiveContext } from 'react-responsive';
import App from './components/App';

const appHtml = renderToString(
  <ResponsiveContext.Provider
    value={{
      // isMobile is inferred out of the `userAgent`
      width: isMobile ? 1194 : TBD,
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </ResponsiveContext.Provider>,
);
```
