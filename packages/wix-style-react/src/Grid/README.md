# Grid
### * Please avoid using Grid,  use \<Layout/\> instead *

### Description:
A grid is a collection of `<Container/>`, `<Row/>` and `<Col/>` components that help laying out
content with ease.

`<Container/>` is based on `<Row/>`s with 12 `<Col/>`umns layout.

All components except for `<Container/>` can be nested.

```js
import {Container, Row, Col} from 'wix-style-react';

export default () =>
  <Container>
    <Row>
      <Col>Left</Col>
      <Col>Middle</Col>
      <Col>Right</Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>;
```

### Examples:

  <summary>Nested grid example</summary>

  ```js
  import {Container, Row, Col} from 'wix-style-react';

  export default () =>
    <Container>
      <Row>
        <Col>Left</Col>

        <Col>
          <Row>
            <Col span={6}>Nested left</Col>
            <Col span={6}>Nested right</Col>
          </Row>
        </Col>

        <Col>Right</Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>;
  ```

  <summary>`<Container/>`</summary>

  Use as wrapper for main content. Only `<Row/>`s should be its children.

  By default it has `minWidth: 894px` and `maxWidth: 1254px`. Add `fluid` prop to remove those widths.

  `fluid` allows to use grid for any content, be it big (whole page layout) or small (form element layout, for example).

  | propName  | propType | defaultValue | isRequired | description                                           |
  | ---       | ---      | ---          | ---        | ---                                                   |
  | children  | node     | -            | -          | Should only be `<Row/>`s although any node is allowed |
  | fluid     | bool     | false        | -          | disable min/max width, use for smaller grids          |
  | dataHook  | string   | -            | -          | hook for testing purposes                             |

  > **Note**: when `<Container/>` is used as full width component, it is possible for horizontal
  > scrollbar to appear. It is because of negative margins on `<Row>`s that come from bootstrap

  > To circumvent, use `html, body { overflow-x: hidden; }`

  <summary>`<Row/>`</summary>

<details>
  <summary>`<AutoAdjustedColumns/>`</summary>

  A row of columns with as many columns as children with the same width.
  Can be used for multiple (not more than 12) equal cards on the same row.
  If you want that the children will be the at the same height,
  just add `height: 100%;` to them (if there isn't already).
  if it's a card just add the `stretchVertically` prop.

  > Note that the span of each element will be `12 % {children.length}`, so in case of result greater than 0, you'll get incomplete line
